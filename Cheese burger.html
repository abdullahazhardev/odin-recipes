      <b><u>Description:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      A cheeseburger is a classic comfort food that combines juicy, seasoned
      ground beef patties with melted cheese, sandwiched between soft, toasted
      buns. The patty, often made from a blend of 80% lean and 20% fat ground
      beef, is seasoned simply with salt and pepper or enhanced with additional
      spices like garlic powder or Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor. Once
      cooked to perfection, the hot patty is topped with a slice of cheese,
      typically cheddar, American, or Swiss, which melts into a gooey layer that
      adds richness to every bite. <br />
      Complementing the savory patty and cheese are fresh toppings such as crisp
      lettuce, ripe tomato slices, and crunchy pickles, along with caramelized
      or raw onions for a burst of flavor. Condiments like ketchup, mustard, or
      mayonnaise are spread on the buns, adding tangy and creamy notes. Optional
      ingredients like crispy bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms, or even a fried egg
      elevate the cheeseburger to gourmet levels. Whether enjoyed at a barbecue,
      a diner, or home, a cheeseburger is a universally loved meal that
      satisfies cravings for both simplicity and indulgence.

    <ol>
      <li><b>Prepare the Patties</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a bowl, combine ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) with a pinch of
          salt and pepper. Optional: Add seasonings like garlic powder, onion
          powder, or Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the beef into equal portions (about 4‚Äì6 oz per patty) and
          gently shape them into round patties, slightly larger than your buns.
          Make a small indent in the center to prevent puffing while cooking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Preheat the Cooking Surface</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat a skillet, grill pan, or outdoor grill to medium-high heat.

        <li>Lightly oil the surface to prevent sticking.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Cook the Patties</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place the patties on the hot surface and cook for 3‚Äì4 minutes on one
          side until browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flip the patties and cook for another 3‚Äì4 minutes or until your
          desired doneness (e.g., medium-rare: 130¬∞F, medium: 140¬∞F).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each
          patty and cover with a lid or foil to melt.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Toast the Buns</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Slice the burger buns in half and lightly butter them.</li>

          crisp.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Assemble the Cheeseburger</b></li>
      <ul>

          Spread your choice of condiments (e.g., ketchup, mustard, mayo) on the
          bottom bun.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add lettuce, a slice of tomato, and optional toppings like pickles or
          onions.
