      <b><u>Description</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its rich layers of flavor
      and comforting texture. At its core, lasagna consists of wide, flat pasta
      sheets layered with a hearty filling, often a combination of savory meat
      sauce, creamy ricotta or b√©chamel, and gooey melted cheese like mozzarella
      or Parmesan. The sauce, typically made from tomatoes, garlic, and aromatic
      herbs, infuses the dish with a deep, satisfying flavor. Each layer is
      carefully assembled, creating a beautifully structured casserole that‚Äôs
      baked to golden perfection.<br />
      The magic of lasagna lies in its versatility. While the traditional recipe
      often includes ground beef or Italian sausage, vegetarian versions with
      spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini are equally popular. With its balanced
      combination of carbs, protein, and rich sauces, lasagna is a meal that
      pleases both the palate and the soul. Whether served at a casual family
      dinner or a festive gathering, this iconic dish is a symbol of warmth and
      indulgence that brings people together around the table.

    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare the Meat Sauce</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef or Italian sausage and cook until browned. Drain
            excess fat if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic, cooking until softened.</li>
          <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and
            seasonings (Italian herbs, salt, pepper).
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer the sauce for 20‚Äì30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let
            the flavors meld.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, one egg, Parmesan cheese,
            and a pinch of salt.
          </li>
          <li>Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if needed)</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions</li>
          <li>Drain and lay them flat on a clean towel to prevent sticking.</li>
          <li>Skip this step if using no-boil noodles.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble the Lasagna</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).</li>
          <li>
            In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce to prevent
            sticking.
          </li>
          <li>Lay down a single layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
          <li>
            Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a layer of meat sauce, then sprinkle shredded mozzarella on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, sauce, mozzarella) until the
            dish is filled, ending with a generous layer of mozzarella.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake the Lasagna </b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (tent it slightly to
            prevent cheese from sticking).
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for 25‚Äì30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an
            additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rest and Serve </b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let the lasagna rest for 10‚Äì15 minutes after removing it from the
            oven. This helps it set and makes slicing easier.
          </li>
          <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
